# hnec 
Just playing around with converting the old Xnecview program to C#. 

The original was licensed under GPL 2 and I'm leaving it under that older GPL version for now.

At this point it's completely non-functional and is just a work-in-progress
to see if I can do it and if it's worth the trouble to do.  :^)
